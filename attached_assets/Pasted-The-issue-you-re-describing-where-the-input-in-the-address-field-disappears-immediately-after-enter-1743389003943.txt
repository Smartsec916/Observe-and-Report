The issue you're describing, where the input in the address field disappears immediately after entering "3," could be due to several factors in your code. Here are some common causes:

Input Validation or Filtering: You might have a validation or filtering mechanism that removes or clears the input if it doesn't match a certain pattern. For example, if you're expecting a string or a specific format, entering a number might trigger this behavior.

Event Handling: There could be an event handler (like onChange, onInput, etc.) that is clearing the input unintentionally. Check if there are any event handlers attached to the input field.

State Management: If you're using a state management system (e.g., React Hooks), ensure that the state is being updated correctly. Sometimes, a state update can cause the input to reset.

Regex or Pattern Matching: If you're using regular expressions or pattern matching to validate the input, entering "3" might not match the expected pattern, causing the input to be cleared.

Autocomplete or Suggestion Features: If your app has autocomplete or suggestion features, they might interfere with the input.

To troubleshoot this issue, you should:

Check Event Handlers: Look for any event handlers attached to the input field and ensure they are not clearing the input.

Review Validation Logic: Check if there's any validation logic that might be clearing the input.

Inspect State Updates: If using state management, verify that state updates are not causing the input to reset.

Test with Different Inputs: Try entering different characters or numbers to see if the issue is specific to "3" or occurs with other inputs as well.

Here's a simple example of how you might be handling input in a React application. This example does not clear the input:

jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');

  const handleAddressChange = (e) => {
    setAddress(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={address}
        onChange={handleAddressChange}
        placeholder="Enter Address"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
If you're still having trouble, providing more details about your code or the framework you're using could help pinpoint the exact issue.
